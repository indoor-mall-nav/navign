## üé¨ Demo Recommendations

### Option 1: Live Demo (if available)
1. **Hand tracking**: Show real-time gesture recognition on screen
2. **Object detection**: Point at object, show identification
3. **Voice command**: Demonstrate wake word and command

### Option 2: Pre-recorded Video
1. Full pipeline demo: voice ‚Üí gesture ‚Üí robot action
2. Show mobile app navigation
3. Play robot delivery animation from `animations/robot.py`

### Option 3: Slides Only
- Use the Mermaid diagrams and code snippets
- Rely on clear explanations and visualizations

## ‚ùì Anticipated Q&A

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the positioning accuracy?**
A: <2m for BLE beacon triangulation, ~5cm for object localization with AprilTags.

**Q: How does it compare to UWB positioning?**
A: BLE is 10-100x cheaper than UWB while providing sufficient accuracy for indoor navigation and robot guidance.

**Q: Is video/audio data stored?**
A: No, all processing happens locally on-device. Privacy is built-in.

**Q: What about false positives in gesture recognition?**
A: We use 70% dropout and data augmentation. Wake word prevents accidental activation.

### Business Questions

**Q: What's the cost per robot?**
A: Estimated ~$5k-10k (Raspberry Pi/Jetson + servos + BLE), vs. $50k+ for commercial delivery robots.

**Q: What's the deployment timeline?**
A: Currently prototype phase. Gesture recognition is production-ready. Robot hardware in development.

**Q: Can this work in hospitals/airports?**
A: Yes! The system is designed for any indoor venue with BLE beacon infrastructure.

### Accessibility Questions

**Q: How does this help blind users?**
A: Voice-guided navigation + obstacle detection replaces guide dogs at 1% of the cost.

**Q: What about users with limited mobility?**
A: Delivery mode brings items to users. Guide mode can slow down for wheelchairs.
